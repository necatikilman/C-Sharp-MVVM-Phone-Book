# C-Sharp-MVVM-Phone-Book
A simple WPF application that is built using MVVM architecture in .NET Framework.

This application is used to manage contacts. We can add new contacts, or change the existing ones. We can remove contacts as well. The contacts are being displayed on the left side of the window in a dynamic listbox that gets automaticallly updated each time that the contact list has been changed.
